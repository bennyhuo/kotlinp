# kotlinp

This is a copy of [JetBrains/Kotlin - kotlinp](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/tools/kotlinp). 

**kotlinp** is a commandline tool to print Kotlin declarations in the given class file. You can also use this to print the metadata packaged into *.class or *.kotlin_module.

Kotlin Team does not publish this library to maven. So I published it to maven central for convenience.

```
